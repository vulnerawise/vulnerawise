# Vulnerawise White Paper

## The Case for Actionable Vulnerability Intelligence

### Executive Summary

In today’s software-driven world, organizations face an overwhelming number of vulnerabilities. Security teams are inundated with scanner results and CVE feeds, yet lack the context to know what to fix first. Traditional triage based on severity scores like CVSS leads to wasted time, missed threats, and growing backlogs.

**Vulnerawise** solves this by providing contextual, component-level vulnerability intelligence that prioritizes real threats using real-world exploitability data. This white paper outlines the cost of manual triage, the inefficiencies of current approaches, and the tangible ROI of adopting Vulnerawise.

## The Problem: Noise Overload, No Priority

Security and development teams often receive thousands of vulnerability findings per month:

* Scanner outputs are verbose, duplicative, and often misleading
* CVSS severity scores do not reflect real-world risk
* Many medium-severity CVEs are actively exploited, while some critical ones are not

### Consequences:

* Time wasted investigating low-risk vulnerabilities
* Delays in fixing truly dangerous flaws
* Developers overwhelmed by spreadsheets
* Security analysts burning out from manual triage

## The Hidden Cost of Vulnerability Triage

### Time Per Vulnerability

Industry data shows:

* **Average triage time per CVE:** 10–30 minutes
* **Source:** NVIDIA Security Automation Report; Phoenix Security ROI Study

### Cost Per Vulnerability

* **Labor cost per triage:** \$8–\$30 per CVE
* Based on AppSec engineer rates (\$50–\$100/hr)
* **Source:** Ponemon + Rezilion; MITRE DevSecOps Cost Models

> A team handling 1,000 CVEs/month could spend **250–500 hours** just triaging, costing **\$25,000+** per month in labor.

### Triage Volume in the Real World

* Mid-sized dev teams (\~100 devs) often generate 900+ findings/month
* False positive rates range from 35% to 50%
* Most orgs remediate only 5–10% of open vulns per month
* **Sources:** Cyentia Institute; Kenna Security; Rezilion; Phoenix Security

## Vulnerawise: How It Works

**Vulnerawise** applies the SSVC (Stakeholder-Specific Vulnerability Categorization) framework to:

* Enrich each CVE with real-world exploitability and maturity status
* Group findings per **component** instead of per CVE
* Recommend final **fix version** per package
* Assign decisions: **Immediate**, **Out-of-Cycle**, **Scheduled**, **Defer**

### Output Example:

```
Component: log4j-core
CVE Count: 4
Fixed Version: 2.17.1
Decision: Immediate
```

> Result: Teams spend time applying 1 fix, not analyzing 4 CVEs.

## ROI: Triage and Prioritization Efficiency

### Baseline: Manual Process (per 47 components)

* Triage time: 47 hours
* Remediation planning: 235 hours
* Total: 282 hours @ \$62.50/hr = \$17,625

### With Vulnerawise

* Triage: 0 hours
* Remediation planning: 235 hours (same fix effort)
* Total: \$14,687.50

### Savings

* **Time saved:** 47 hours
* **Cost saved:** \$2,937.50
* **ROI:** 20% from triage automation alone

> Scale this to 1,000+ components per year: \$60K+ in savings and a faster response to real threats.

---

## Key Differentiators

* **Exploit-focused**: Filters CVEs based on actual exploitation, not just theoretical severity
* **Component-centric**: Maps multiple CVEs to a single actionable fix
* **No guesswork**: Final decision provided per package
* **Scalable**: API- and CLI-ready for CI/CD, registries, or platform integration

---

## Conclusion

Manual vulnerability triage is expensive, inefficient, and unsustainable at scale. Organizations can no longer afford to treat all vulnerabilities equally or spend hours manually researching every CVE.

**Vulnerawise empowers teams to:**

* Focus on the 10% of vulnerabilities that truly matter
* Fix what matters first, with confidence
* Cut triage costs by 30–60%
* Reduce time to remediation
* Improve security posture with real-world risk context

Let your security and developer teams work smarter. Eliminate the triage burden.

**Prioritize what matters. Act with confidence.**

**Choose Vulnerawise.**
