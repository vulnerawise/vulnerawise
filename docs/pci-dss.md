# White Paper: Achieving PCI DSS v4.0 Vulnerability Management Compliance with Vulnerawise

## Executive Summary

The PCI DSS v4.0 standard is a transformative shift in how organizations must approach vulnerability management. No longer is it acceptable to prioritize vulnerabilities solely by CVSS score or focus only on criticals. PCI DSS v4.0 mandates risk-based, contextual triage and remediation for **every** vulnerability—regardless of severity.

**Vulnerawise** is designed to meet and exceed these new expectations. By delivering actionable, contextual vulnerability intelligence and mapping CVEs directly to fixable components, Vulnerawise empowers organizations to eliminate manual triage overhead, reduce risk exposure, and align seamlessly with PCI DSS v4.0 requirements.

## PCI DSS v4.0: A New Era for Vulnerability Management

With the release of v4.0, PCI DSS has introduced stronger, clearer mandates for vulnerability identification, triage, prioritization, and remediation:

* **6.3.1**: Organizations must monitor for vulnerabilities from industry-recognized sources and assign risk rankings to all of them.
* **6.3.2**: Maintain a complete inventory of all software components.
* **6.3.3**: Apply patches based on risk, not just severity, within defined timeframes.
* **11.3.1.1**: Every vulnerability identified via scans must have a risk analysis and remediation plan—even if it’s not high or critical.
* **12.10.5**: Security alerts from vulnerability scans must inform your incident response process.

**Bottom line:** Every vulnerability must be accounted for, ranked by risk, and tracked to resolution. The days of ignoring "medium" or "low" CVEs are over.

## The Compliance Challenges

Many organizations struggle to:

* Keep up with thousands of new vulnerabilities each month
* Rank CVEs accurately and consistently
* Maintain real-time component inventories
* Prove to auditors that each CVE has a remediation plan
* Avoid false positives and alert fatigue

Manual triage costs time and money:

* **600 CVEs/month** = 150 hours triage
* **\$75/hr labor rate** = **\$11,250/month** = **\$135,000/year** in triage cost alone

This is unsustainable—especially at enterprise scale.

## How Vulnerawise Aligns with PCI DSS v4.0

### ✅ Requirement 6.3.1: Security vulnerabilities are identified and risk-ranked based on industry best practices and applicable risk factors

This requirement ensures organizations do more than rely on generic severity scores. It mandates a consistent, contextual process to evaluate risk based on exploitation likelihood, system exposure, and potential business impact. Vulnerawise helps by applying real-world exploitability intelligence and decision models to automate and standardize this process.

* Integrates threat intelligence to show if a CVE is actively exploited, has a PoC, or is trending
* Uses a decision-tree model (based on SSVC) to assign **Immediate**, **Out-of-Cycle**, **Scheduled**, or **Defer** actions per component
* Supports defensible, auditable risk rankings

### ✅ Requirement 6.3.2: An inventory of bespoke and third-party software components is maintained to support response to vulnerabilities

Without a comprehensive and current software inventory, organizations cannot quickly assess if they're affected by new CVEs. This requirement compels organizations to track all deployed software. Vulnerawise helps by mapping vulnerabilities to components discovered via SBOMs or scanner outputs, ensuring visibility across modern, container-based environments.

* Ingests scan data (from Trivy, Grype, etc.)
* Maps all CVEs to fixable components with version-specific upgrade paths
* Tracks each unique software component across containers, hosts, and pipelines

### ✅ Requirement 6.3.3: Security vulnerabilities are assigned a risk ranking and are addressed based on risk

This mandates that vulnerability remediation is prioritized not by arbitrary timelines, but by actual risk context. Critical vulnerabilities must be patched within a month, while lower-risk ones require documented timelines. Vulnerawise provides automated, policy-driven timelines based on exploit maturity, system criticality, and environmental exposure.

* Automatically generates fix recommendations and timelines
* Highlights quick wins (e.g., fix one component to resolve 10 CVEs)
* Ensures high-risk CVEs are patched within 30 days; others are deferred with justification

### ✅ Requirement 11.3.1.1: Results of periodic vulnerability scans are reviewed and addressed as an ongoing process

All vulnerabilities discovered in scans, even low-risk ones, must be evaluated and have a documented remediation plan or risk acceptance. This is where many organizations struggle with scale. Vulnerawise automates the prioritization and generates audit-ready remediation plans aligned with policy for every finding.

* Provides per-vulnerability decision logs
* Documents rationale for deferrals or de-prioritization of non-critical issues
* Creates a paper trail for auditors

### ✅ Requirement 12.10.5: The incident response plan includes monitoring and responding to alerts from security monitoring systems

This ensures that vulnerability alerts aren’t siloed. Any exploit attempts or alerts from detection systems must feed into incident response processes. Vulnerawise enables this by integrating exploit intelligence and asset context with existing IR systems, helping teams respond quickly to threats targeting known weak points.

* Integrates with SIEMs and ticketing tools via API
* Alerts on emerging threats linked to current components
* Flags potential incidents based on exploit maturity

## Real Results: Efficiency & ROI

**Before Vulnerawise:**

* Manual triage of 600 CVEs/month = 150 hours = **\$11,250/month**
* No context on exploitation or urgency
* Audit chaos: no documented decisions for most CVEs

**After Vulnerawise:**

* Triage cost reduced 90% = **\$1,125/month**
* Risk-based prioritization built-in
* All CVEs assigned policy-backed remediation plans
* Audit-ready records with one click

**Annual savings:** \$121,500+ in analyst time alone—not counting faster remediation, reduced breach risk, and headcount avoidance.

Whether you're in fintech, retail, healthcare, SaaS, or hospitality:

* Vulnerawise adapts to your policies and environment
* Supports multi-cloud, CI/CD, and container-native workflows
* Aligns with modern AppSec and DevSecOps practices

You don’t need 10 more analysts. You need smarter triage.
